Development Plan 05-27-2019:
- Use latest pybind11 master
- Review binder and clean-up
- Get all enums binded
- Get all functions binded
- Get all classes NOT derived from Standard::Handle binded
  - Start with single inheritance
  - Then multiple inheritance
  - Remember to check py::multiple_inheritance flag if needed
  - Typedefs defined from these classes
- Get immutable and reference inputs handles
- Get circular dependency for these types handled
- Get system to compile and run with everything except things
  derived from Handle
- Then start work on Handle stuff...


Misc:
- Rethink Deleter<> usage
- Rethink unique_ptr implementation
- Typename keyword for Linux in templates
- How to handle types that get reset with "=" in implementation?
